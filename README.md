This is a simple GUI-based news summarizer that extracts the title, author,
publish date, summary, and sentiment of a news article from a given URL. 
It uses the tkinter module for the graphical user interface, the newspaper module for article extraction, and the textblob module for sentiment analysis.

Usage
